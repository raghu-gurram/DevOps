Step11: Now right click on App.java->Run as->Maven Test
Step12: Now right click on App.java->Run as->Maven Build
Step13: In Goals, Type “clean install test”, click on apply next click on Run, for building the MavenJava project.
Step14: Every phase is checked and BUILD SUCCESS message can be seen in the console. 
Step15: Now right click on App.java->Run as->Java Application, click on OK.
Step16: Hello world is shown as output for MavenJava Project.
Creation of Maven Web Project Procedure Steps:
Step1: Open Eclipse IDE for Enterprise JAVA and WEB developers.
Step2: Click on File->New->Maven Project

Step7: We can see our MavenWeb project ready with its own pom.xml file in the Project Explorer tool bar menu present at the left side.
Step8: Now click on MavenWeb->src->main->Webapp->index.jsp where we can find a code sample for HELLO WORLD.
Step9: Now open browser and open mvnrepository.com
Step10: Search for JAVA servlet API and click on the latest version.
Step11: Copy the dependency code of the servlet. And paste it in MavenWeb’s pom.xml under target folder.

Step18: Now right click on index.jsp ->Run as->Maven Clean
Step19: Now right click on index.jsp ->Run as->Maven Install
Step20: Now right click on index.jsp ->Run as->Maven Test
Step21: Now right click on index.jsp ->Run as->Maven Build
Step22: In Goals, Type “clean install test”, click on apply next click on Run, for building the MavenWeb project.
Step23: Every phase is checked and BUILD SUCCESS message can be seen in the console. 
Step24: Now right click on index.jsp ->Run as->Run on server, click on OK.
Step25: Select choose an existing server and click on finish.
Step26: Hello world Webpage is shown as output for MavenWeb Project.

Steps to Push the Maven Projects to GIT:
Java Project Push Procedure Steps:
Step1: Create two repositories for MavenJava and MavenWeb projects in your GitHUB account.
Step2: In eclipse right click on MavenJava folder present in project explorer and select show in local terminal option->GitBash.
Step3: execute: git init-> git branch –M main.
Step4: Now add your repository to the MavenJava using, git remote add origin <git java repository url> command.
Step5: execute: git add . -> git commit –m “Maven java push” -> git push –u origin main
Step6: Now refresh your GitHub account and we can see our MavenJava files are pushed to MavenJava repository in your GitHub account.
Web Project Push Procedure Steps:
Step1: In eclipse right click on MavenWeb folder present in project explorer and select show in local terminal option->GitBash.
Step2: execute: git init-> git branch –M main.
Step3: Now add your repository to the MavenWeb using, git remote add origin <git Web repository url> command.
Step4: Push your web project same as Java to GitHub. 
Step5: Now refresh your GitHub account and we can see our MavenWeb files are pushed to MaveWeb repository in your GitHub account.

Conclusion: we have learnt creation of Java and Web project through Maven and pushing them to GitHub.
